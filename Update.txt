Update from tuesdays demo
1. We managed to get the floating point mac unit design working.
2. We further parallelized this model by adding 8 MAC units that would run in parallel. 
   The issue with this implementation was that we ran out of LUTs while implementation.
   Hence we disabled output registers of 6 MAC units. This does not affect the correctness or runtime of of the 
   PL, we just saved some LUTs for testing purposes. We were able to test runtimes of our implementation and we checked the
   correctness of MAC units by setting all values to 1.0 and checking whether we get 512 as o/p. We could not test the correctness 
   of the implementation with actual data as we had difficulty extracting the output of LSTM from pytorch within the deadline (We had troble
   decoupling LSTM layer from the FCN layer).
